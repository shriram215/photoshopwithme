		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there!, I'm just 18 years old and I tried doing few things online like, In 2017, I started a YouTube channel all about gaming and continued it for a couple of months and I didn't get much reach so left it. And in the year 2019, I had a little bit of intrest in coding and as well as in photo editings too. So i learnt Html, C++, Python. And I built up this webpage using Html and CSS. This webpage is to share my experience in photo editing and also to test my programming skills. Hope you like my content, if so follow me on Instagram and join me on my journey as I share what I'm learning new in Photoshop.</p>
